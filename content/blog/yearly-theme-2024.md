I felt like I zero'd in on a bunch of things I liked in 2023. Later in the year I was thinking a lot about JPG Coaching on Tiktok talking about how its way harder to make gym progress unless you actually really go to muscle failure.

It seemed like it was relevant to more than just the gym and I was sorta half-assing a few things. Wanted to be a bit more thoughtful about how I was trying to do stuff.

This year I did a lot of leetcode and learned more about how to write Go. Made some gym gains and paid a lot closer attention to my ski turns.
