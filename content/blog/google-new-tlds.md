May is also the month of Google I/O, our annual developer conference. .foo, .zip, .mov and .nexus are perfect whether you're learning to code, deploying a helpful tool, building your portfolio, or starting a new community. Check out some of the websites already using these TLDs:

- **gamers.nexus**: Review computer hardware and plan your next gaming PC
- **helloworld.foo**: Learn how to code "hello world" in each programming language
- **url.zip**: Create short, powerful and trackable links
- <mark>**david.mov**: Watch videos by David Imel in this liminal space</mark>

Starting today, you can register all of these new extensions as part of our Early Access Program for an additional one-time fee. This fee decreases according to a daily schedule through the end of May 10. On May 10 at 16:00 UTC, all of these domains will be publicly available at a base annual price through your registrar of choice. To make it super easy for anyone to get their website live, we've worked with Google Sites to launch new templates for graduates, professors and parents.
