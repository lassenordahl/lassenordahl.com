Will keep updating this until I figure it out.

1. First batch - accidentally cooked the egg in with the custard and didn't poke holes in the bottom of the pastry. Good taste but too much of a quiche texture.

2. Had to use cinnamon powder instead of cinnamon sticks (out of stock), made the custard brown, added _too_ much egg and flour and didn't get the soft liquid custard. Tasted like a big cinnamon toast crunch. Still good taste but I think I just like butter.
