This yearly theme was make more things. Started off buying a 3d printer to make lamps - printed some fun things, tried to do more fun coding projects in the later half of the year, inhaled way too much spray paint and microplastic.

Cutting wood in the 51 Dean St, Apt 4 bullshit room was overly ambitious.

Year of talking about the 3D Mall and my job (Palantir 3D Work) ended up being really creative.
