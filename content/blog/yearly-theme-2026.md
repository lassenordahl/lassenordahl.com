EOY break gave me a nice bit of time to reflect and write. I also bought a SECOND notebook having finished the first one I bought last November.

[Peyton](https://pawa.lt/) and [Jack](https://jackcook.com/) have been pretty inspiring to me, and are a lot more writing oriented than I usually am.

I think writing more of everything would be fun. More cards, notebook pages, weird code projects, texts, whatever. Wrapping up this year with a markdown blog seems like a good start.
